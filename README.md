I created this repository as per the Mobiquity request to do the exercise. Please clone if you would like to test and see the results localy. After cloning the repo run : 

> npm install

after that you can run the project by:

>ng serve    (You should have @angular/cli installed from npm)

and navigate to  `http://localhost:4200/`. 


The project is written in Angular 6 and Bootstrap 4 and I tried to show the common structure I always follow in my large scale programs. 

## Project Structure

The project is consists of some lazy loaded components for diferent part including the Header, Sidebar, SeasonList and Resuts. there is also a service layer to fetch the API json files. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
